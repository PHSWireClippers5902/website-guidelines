# Writer Standards
Based on WCAG 2.1. This is being drafted and doesn’t contain all necessary elements in a standards document. 

## Accessibility Guidelines

| Compliance | Level |
|--------------|-----------|
| WCAG 2.1 A | Compliant     |
| WCAG 2.1 AA | In Progress  |
| WCAG 2.1 AAA | Not Started  |

Our goal is to make sure our website is accessible to as many people as possible. Obviously, we can’t expect perfection from everyone, but keep these in mind when writing articles, pages, or posts. (All of these are based on WCAG 2.1)

### Do’s:
- Use headers to break up information. Use distinctive language at the beginning. (Section 2.4.6, Section 2.4.10)
- Make descriptive links. (Section 2.4.9)
- Dumb down your language to about a 6th-7th grade reading level. If not everyone can understand the word, try to explain it. (Section 3.1.5)
### Don’ts:
- “Click here” links. (Section 2.4.9)

## How to Write an Article
Articles are written when we need one. 

### Use Headers
All of our content should be easily accessible and look nice on the website. In order to split up teams, we use headers.

In order to create a header in WordPress:
1. Create a new line by hitting enter at the end of a paragraph
2. Hit the `/` key and type "Header"
3. Type in the name. Normal names used are "Business" "Build" and "Programming." Personally ([lwu877](https://github.com/lwu877)) I create a "Closing Notes" header at the end to summarise it all up - you don't need to do that, but it's nice.

It's an easy way to guarantee screen readers can understand our content.

### Use photos!
There's a box called "Featured Image" that appears when you select the sidebar on a post. [Documentation](https://wordpress.com/support/featured-images/) on this should be simple to follow.
In addition, it also helps if you add some images and sprinkle in a gallery into the article. Because we're using JetPack, use the block "Tiled Gallery" to make sure it all loads properly. 

### Common sense is a virtue
Just because we *can* publish something doesn't mean we **need** to. In short:
- No cursing.

That's all you should need to know about writing!
