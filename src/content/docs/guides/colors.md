They make up a significant portion of the user's experience.
Use the wrong colours, and the user might think we're completely unprofessional.
(We're hosting our website standards in a public GitHub repository. The point still stands.)

Use this as guidance, and feel free to change up the colours if necessary. Just make sure the colour contrast still stands.

:::note 
There's no previews of the colors - yet. You have two options.
- Visit the (somewhat outdated) Google Doc in our internal drive at General Team -> Website -> Website/Design Standards
- Copy and paste these hex codes into Google.

We'll come up with a solution.

### Usage
- Background is used primarily.
- Use Contrast 1 and Contrast 2 to help break up space.
- Borders are used around images and around boxes.
- Primary text is used for headings.
- Secondary text is used for body content - like words.

#### Surfaces vs. Containers
Surfaces are used for places where you need to put emphasis on stuff. They aren’t used for clickable items like buttons.

Containers are used for buttons. 
- Use the primary container for most stuff.
- Use the secondary container for stuff that shouldn’t be highlighted. 

#### Primary vs Secondary
Use the primary and secondary colors as highlights. Use the accent text with their corresponding accents. 

:::caution
Don't use secondary accent and secondary accent text for small text. Use primary instead.
This is due to low colour contrast, which makes legilibity difficult at smaller sizes. 
:::

Use primary and secondary containers for clickable objects like buttons. Use the corresponding container text for these clickable objects.
