So, you need some files.

Downloading files off the official website ([wireclippers.org](https://wireclippers.org)) will output your photos in WebP format, because the files are smaller and this allows us to get our website loaded faster. 

However, it's more annoying to you, the webmaster.

As a solution, every single photo on this website is deliered in .jpg or .png format. You can download them off this website or dive into our
[files on Github](https://github.com/PHSWireClippers5902/website-guidelines/tree/main/src/assets) to find the branding element that you need. 

You should also be able to get access to photos cleared for release on the Discord.

For more information on how to use this, see [our guide on using colors.](https://phswireclippers5902.github.io/website-guidelines/guides/colors/)
