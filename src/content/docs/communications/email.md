## Basic Layout

Just so we all have a standard for writing email. Feel free to copy and paste this if you need it.

``` 
To [person]:

[message]

Thanks (or any other closing),

[Name]
[Position]

[Additional Name if necessary]
[Additional Position if necessary]
```

If we have multiple signatures in an email or in written communication, the higher-ranking person goes first. (Letters are weird.)

The only difference between email and a letter is that we have a little header at the top of a regular letter. 

## Writing the Letter

Here's a few tips for you to write the perfect email - something that someone will most likely read in its entirety, and something that someone will be able to process while they're busy.

### Keep it Short n' Sweet

Keeping the paragraph sizes down is something that we're not taught in school. We're always taught that paragraphs should be filled to the brim with details and backing evidence. Paragraphs don't always have to be that - and for emails, it's better to keep it short.
