You're here to learn how to write for swerve. Is it hard? Yes. Is it easy? Also yes. The following guide will lead you
through a comprehensive guide of swerve coding, commanding, and subsystem work.

Start by opening up your preferred IDE (like VSCode) and looking through <a href="/SwerveDocumentation.pdf">our full documentation.</a>

(Sorry about this solution - the PDF contains plenty of rich media that wouldn't really work in a markdown file.)
